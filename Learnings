Source: End to End Project Development using Spring Boot on Udemy by Bharath 

Even though the UI is really simple but from this short , simple but really knowledge-worthy project , I was able to
  learn very important things which I'll summarize below in points:
 > Implement MVC architecture
 > Different layers and classes needed to implement and their usecases and also the standard naming we should follow 
 >Presentation Layer, Service Layer , Data Access Layer.
 >We created View using JSP initially, but the author was helpful enough to update the course and even implemented 
 it using Thymeleaf. It eventually helped understand the differences between the implementation of both(There wasn't 
 much though).
 >We coded the utility layer where we implemented email usecase. Used gmail for the same. 
 > Also in utility , we can implement third-party APIS. In this one, we used JFreeChart, a third party API used to
 generate charts using the dataset we get from database.
 
  JFreeChart is a popular Java library for creating charts. JFreeChart allows to create a wide variety of both 
  interactive and non-interactive charts. We can create line charts, bar charts, area charts, scatter charts, 
  pie charts, gantt charts and various specialized charts such as wind chart or bubble chart.
 
At the moment, I'm facing some error in displaying the chart at the required url. I hope I learn enough to
get rid of the issue myself. But otherewise works fine. :)

TOOLS/TECH: STS IDE, Spring Boot, MySQL Workbench, Maven, JSP, Thymeleaf, JFreeChart. 


This project really helped me to actually understand how to implement MVC architecture. I've definitely added
some skills after implementing this one.
